Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
-- The client was the owner of a web based gaming application  that had to do with drawing images to match others. this game had to be multiplayer and cross platform. this meant it must be able to allow players to team up and face eachother or do solo one versus one.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
-- in my opinoion what i did most well in this document was properly lay all the requirements out in an order that ease easily understandable.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
-- Definetely, having this document gave me a pattern to follow that helped em tremendously.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-- I would honestly revise everything, this because i was so busy throughout this whole document that i did not get put my all into it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-- i took the user needs requested by the client and did research on each individul need for the game application. in adittion, the users needs is important because they are the send purpose of this application. without the user theres no reson to even create the app. therefore, they must be thought of in all aspects development.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
-- my first approach is reviewing the requirements and researching them further. secondly, after using this template i feel it would be a must everytime. like trades have multiple tools this is definetely a tool for software development.
